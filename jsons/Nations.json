The final outcome of the mutations disappointed most of the mages, who began referring to the result as 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. The Order didn't last long however – its members had abandoned most of the original 'warrior' values over time and soon split into a handful of witcher schools, aimed at taking a more professional approach to eradicating monsters.",

Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, you embark upon a noble quest to vanquish malevolence and protect the innocent from the encroaching forces of evil. Notorious master of mutation, the destiny of your order and the fates of countless lives now lie within your capable hands. Will you heed the call and harness the power of magic and swordsmanship to lead the Order of Witchers to triumph? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?",

The original idea for the formation of the Order coined after the fall of Morlovia, which caused many vampires to flee to the north and northwest. Argos, Praetor of Machinia, didn't bother with the runaway vampires and chose to conquer Morlovia's territory, and reclaim the area that used to belong to the Jorah Kingdom. Facing the terror of the remnants of vampires, and monsters lurking in the dark, the Order of Witchers was established under the leadership of Mage Cosimo Malaspina."},
			{"text": "After the earliest attempts at creating witchers with adults proved unsatisfactory, it was decided that children would be used for future experiments. They were trained by professionals from all over the continents in their respective skills: the huntsmen taught them to track and hunt, the alchemists on how to brew potions and concoctions, and the swordsmen on how to fight. Despite all this, the children proved unsatisfactory and disappointed most of the mages, who began to call the result 'witchers', charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. The mutations had opened their bodies to the flow of power, but they ended up with limited magical talent."},

The Second Giants, Andarna, came during the Dissolution of Berenger.
