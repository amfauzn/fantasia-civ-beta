			{"text": "Giants are a non-human race considered to be a legend by the inhabitants outside of Laurasia. However, giants do actually exist in Nusa Islands, and never interact with the outside world. The first civilization the giants interacted with was Dwargon, when a group of giants called Förstarna, or the First Giants, crossed the Vänern Sea and settled on the Horn of Laurasia, with whom they periodically clashed. The Second Giants, Andarna, came during the Dissolution of Berenger. The giants, under the leadership of Magnar, formed a mercenary group of giants because of their power and the difficulty of finding plentiful food. Erhab, meaning terrors, is the name given by the Dwarni to the giants because of their terrifying presence."},

In the Battle of Kar Doral, the giants almost vanquished Dwargon before Higba decided to ride his rudimentary Orichalcum Golem. Acknowledging his opponent's power, Magnar decided to stop the attacks, and later helped Dwargon's defenses after Almira gave Magnar the Heart of Perpetuity as a condition of the 500 Years of Peace treaty."},
